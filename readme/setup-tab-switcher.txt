How to setup another tab-switcher
(default tab-switcher with Ctrl+Tab/ Ctrl+Shift+Tab is not smart, it dont use history):

1) Assign a hotkey for this cmd.
  Hotkey must contain modifier key: Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Win/Meta.
  F3 - bad, Ctrl+Tab - good, Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Win+Q - good.
2) Jump to prev-tab by single press of the hotkey.
3) Hold modifier key(s) and press the hotkey 2 times, to jump to prev-prev-tab (2 steps back).
4) While you hold modifier key(s), cmd jumps more and more back to history (2,3,4... steps back).
5) When you release modifier key(s), next jumping starts from history head.

Note. 
Hotkey without modifier key(s) is legal too. But it will always jump to prev-tab.
